    <h2>Why I Love Bears</h2>
    <p>
      Bears have always held a special place in my heart. There's something magical about their strength, solitude, and softness. 
      Whether I’m seeing them from afar in the North Cascades or at the zoo, I’m always filled with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bears are more than just animals to me—they’re my <strong>spirit animal</strong>. They remind me to stay grounded, embrace stillness, and trust my strength. 
      Like the bear, I feel deeply connected to nature, drawn to quiet moments of reflection, and always protective of the ones I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe we can all learn something from bears: how to rest without guilt, how to stand tall when needed, and how to cherish our personal space and power. 
      Their quiet wisdom is something I carry with me every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite movie ever is <em>Brother Bear</em>, and my dog is even named <strong>Koda</strong> after the lovable bear cub. 
      It’s more than nostalgia—it’s identity, connection, and love.

    <h2>Koda the Dog 🐶</h2>
    <p>
      My dog Koda is named after the little bear from <em>Brother Bear</em>. He’s cuddly, loyal, and full of joy—just like the character.
      Whenever I call his name, I’m reminded of how much bears mean to me and the power of stories in shaping who we are.

    <h2>Bears of Washington State 🌲</h2>
    <p>
      Washington is home to two incredible species: the <strong>black bear</strong> and the elusive <strong>grizzly bear</strong>. 
      From forest trails to mountain peaks, these bears thrive in the wild landscapes I call home.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Black Bears:</strong> Common and often seen in the North Cascades and Olympic Peninsula.</li>
      <li><strong>Grizzly Bears:</strong> Rare but present in remote wilderness zones like the Selkirks.</li>
      <li>Bears are a reminder that the wild still lives here—and we must protect it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every camping trip feels like an invitation to reconnect with nature and maybe even glimpse one of these majestic beings.
