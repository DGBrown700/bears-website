    <h2>Why I Love Bears</h2>
    <p>Bears have always captured my heart with their adorable rounded ears and powerful presence. Growing up in Washington State, I’ve encountered these magnificent creatures both in the wild and at the zoo.</p>

    <p>Some of my fondest memories are from camping trips with my family in the North Cascades. I’ll never forget spotting a bear high up in a fir tree—an unforgettable reminder of the wild beauty all around us.</p>

    <h2>Brother Bear &amp; Koda</h2>
    <p>My all‑time favorite movie is <em>Brother Bear</em>. In fact, I loved it so much that when I adopted my dog, I named him Koda after the playful young bear in the film!</p>
